# Common Mistakes

- Guessing fixes without reading the failing code.
- Fixing downstream errors before the root cause.
- Leaving project configuration issues unresolved when xcodegen tools are needed.
- Stopping after fewer errors instead of zero errors.
- Introducing hardcoded colors/fonts/spacing as quick fixes instead of using AppTheme tokens.
